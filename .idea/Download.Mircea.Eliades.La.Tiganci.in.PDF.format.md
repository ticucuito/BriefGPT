The story follows Gavrilescu, a middle-aged man who escapes from the oppressive heat and boredom of his life by entering a mysterious house inhabited by gypsies. There, he experiences a series of surreal events that challenge his perception of reality and identity. He encounters a beautiful gypsy woman who claims to be his lover, a mysterious old man who holds a tin box, a group of students who recite passages from Colonel Lawrence's book, and a hidden garden where time seems to stand still.
 
La Tiganci is a complex and richly symbolic story that invites multiple interpretations. Some critics have seen it as an allegory of the human condition, a quest for transcendence, or a critique of modernity. Others have focused on the elements of folklore, mythology and religion that Eliade incorporates in his narrative. The story also reflects Eliade's personal interests and experiences, such as his fascination with Oriental cultures, his involvement in the Romanian Legionary Movement, and his exile in France.
